Hello there !
Nature Harmony is a toy where you can place different assets of natural form such as mushrooms or trees which plays different melodies on their own. 
There are 4 different biomes which change the timbre of the melody. Bringing together the same assets improves the melody. There is no winning or losing, it is nothing more than experiment and relaxation.

It's my first post on this site, I am a Game Design student at ICAN and it's my 2nd year studying. 
This project is a prototype of a game we had to do during the first semester where our theme was to make a toy. 
I was in a group of three and I was the programmer, I started learning programmation in late high school and decided to go for a Game Design school to learn how to make games and become better at programmation.  
So I technically do Unity programmation from less than 1 year and I have still a lot to learn. My code is totally not optimized and a lot of bugs are to be reported :D.

You can do whatever you want with this repo and make a even better toy.
